=========================

from the article: Creating a [Steam Trade Bot with Node.js](https://firepowered.org/developer/creating-a-steam-trade-bot-with-node-js/).  This was written in December of 2014 and utilizes node-steam 0.6.8. 

If you're getting `Undefined is not a function` errors at `client.logOn`, you likely have a newer version of node-steam installed.  Please refer to [this comment](https://github.com/rannmann/node-steam-trade-tutorial/issues/4#issuecomment-123386473) for information on installing the correct version.  A new article will be published shortly with node-steam v1.0 in mind.
